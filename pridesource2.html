  { type: "text", content: "Before disco had a name, there was The Sanctuary. Opening in 1969 in Hell's Kitchen, it has been called 'America's first totally uninhibited gay discotheque.' While dual turntables existed before, The Sanctuary was where using them for nonstop dancing really took off." },
  { type: "text", content: "Francis Grasso pioneered the art of beatmatching at The Sanctuary, using two turntables to seamlessly blend records together. This technique, now fundamental to all DJing, was born in this queer-friendly space where the music never stopped." },

  { type: "text", content: "Grasso didn't just play records - he created journeys. Using headphones to cue up the next track, he would match the beats and create seamless transitions that kept dancers moving for hours. This was the birth of modern DJ technique." },
  { type: "text", content: "The Sanctuary was a revolutionary 'multicultural, polymorphous, free-flowing space' where marginalized groups - gay men, women, Black and Latino clubgoers - dominated the dancefloor, but everyone was welcome. It recast the traditional dance hall into something completely new." },
  
  { type: "title", content: "The Pre-Disco Underground" },
  { type: "text", content: "Before disco exploded, underground clubs in New York were experimenting with extended dance mixes. Places like The Sanctuary, The Loft, and private parties were laboratories where DJs learned to read crowds and craft musical experiences." },
  { type: "text", content: "These early spaces were some of the few places where same-sex dancing was possible. This freedom to dance together was what made these clubs special for the gay community." },

  { type: "text", content: "The Bozak CMA-10-2DL mixer was the first high-end DJ mixer built specifically for club use. Gay clubs like The Gallery, Paradise Garage, and Studio 54 were among the first to install these mixers, making them the laboratories where DJs learned to blend records with unprecedented finesse." },
  { type: "text", content: "The two-turntable setup with a professional mixer became the foundation of dance music culture. What started as a way to keep people dancing became an art form - DJs as storytellers, using records to create emotional arcs that could last all night." },

  { type: "text", content: "In February 1970, David Mancuso launched The Loft, an invite-only 'house party' in his NYC apartment. It wasn't a commercial club - no alcohol was sold - which kept police away and allowed gay men and women to dance together openly." },
  { type: "text", content: "Mancuso's parties (billed 'Love Saves the Day') featured an audiophile sound system and an inclusive atmosphere that mixed LGBTQ patrons with straight allies of all races. The Loft established the template of the underground dance party as a haven of acceptance." },
  
  { type: "title", content: "Queer-Friendly Spaces" },
  { type: "text", content: "What made these early clubs special was that they allowed same-sex dancing, though it wasn't always without risk." },
  { type: "text", content: "Even in these more accepting venues, same-sex dancing had to be carefully managed. DJs and staff would sometimes warn patrons to stop dancing together if they sensed potential trouble from less tolerant customers or authorities." },
  { type: "text", content: "Many of the pioneering DJs, whether gay or straight, were playing in spaces that welcomed the gay community and allowed this freedom of expression." },
  
  { type: "title", content: "The Birth of Disco" },
  { type: "text", content: "Disco started in the early 1970s in Black, Latino, and queer communities. It was shaped by soul, funk, and Latin music, and developed in underground clubs in New York like The Loft and The Gallery." },
  { type: "text", content: "Early disco clubs created safer spaces for people excluded from mainstream nightlife—especially Black, brown, and queer folks. The dancefloor was a place for joy, resistance, and communion." },

  { type: "title", content: "The Pioneers" },
  { type: "text", content: "David Mancuso's Loft parties shaped DJ culture and were a training ground for future legends. Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles both played at The Loft, learning from Mancuso's community-oriented approach that centered dancers and superior sound quality." },
  { type: "text", content: "Nicky Siano's The Gallery was another crucial training ground where the art of DJing was refined. Siano, a bisexual DJ, mentored younger DJs and was instrumental in blending soulful grooves for an integrated gay/straight crowd." },

  { type: "text", content: "The Continental Baths opened in 1968 in the basement of the Ansonia Hotel on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It was more than just a gay bathhouse - it was a complete entertainment complex with a full DJ booth, dance floor, and performance stage." },
  { type: "text", content: "Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan got their start at the Continental Baths in New York. This is where two of the most important DJs in history learned their craft, spinning records for a crowd that danced until dawn in towels and swimwear." },
  { type: "text", content: "The Continental Baths was also a launching pad for major performers. Bette Midler got her start there, performing with Barry Manilow as her pianist. The venue proved that gay spaces could nurture mainstream talent while staying true to their underground roots." },
  { type: "text", content: "The Baths featured a state-of-the-art sound system and lighting that rivaled any nightclub. DJs would play extended sets that blended soul, funk, and early disco, creating the template for the all-night dance experience that would define club culture." },
  { type: "text", content: "What made the Continental Baths special was its complete freedom of expression. In an era when being gay was still illegal in most places, the Baths provided a sanctuary where people could be completely themselves while experiencing cutting-edge music and performance." }

  { type: "text", content: "In 1977, Donna Summer released 'I Feel Love,' produced by Giorgio Moroder. This track's all-synthesizer backing was revolutionary - Brian Eno and David Bowie famously declared it 'the sound of the future' that would 'change club music for the next 15 years.'" },
  
  { type: "image", src: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vernigosh/prideimages/main/sylvester_performing.png", caption: "Sylvester - The 'Queen of Disco'" },
  { type: "text", content: "Sylvester was an openly gay Black singer whose hits like 'You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)' (1978) became anthems. His falsetto vocals and androgynous style embodied disco's gay roots, and his influence on dance music was incalculable." },
  { type: "text", content: "Disco's lyrics often revolved around themes of overcoming obstacles, finding strength, and expressing joy despite challenges. These messages of resilience and celebration in the face of adversity continue to resonate in dance music today." },

  { type: "text", content: "In 1979, 'Disco Demolition Night' encouraged fans to destroy disco records in a baseball stadium. The event wasn't just anti-disco—it carried strong racial and homophobic undertones. It was an attack on the communities that created the music." },
  { type: "text", content: "After the music industry turned away from disco, the sound continued to evolve in underground scenes. Queer DJs and dancers kept the music alive in spaces like bathhouses, lofts, and basements." },
  { type: "text", content: "As DJ Frankie Knuckles later quipped, 'house music is disco's revenge.' The underground dance scene persisted and evolved in response to the backlash, taking disco back to its subculture roots." },
  
  { type: "title", content: "Chicago: The Birth of House" },
  { type: "text", content: "From 1977 to 1982, Frankie Knuckles' legendary residency at The Warehouse in Chicago laid the foundation for house music. The genre's name itself comes from 'Warehouse music,' shortened to 'house' by local record stores and clubgoers." },

  { type: "text", content: "By 1983-84, local producers like Jesse Saunders were using the TR-808 to create original house tracks. Saunders' 1984 'On & On,' often cited as the first house record, was made on a TR-808, turning the DJ's art into a producer's medium." },

  { type: "text", content: "Frankie Knuckles obtained a TR-909 drum machine in 1984 (from Detroit's Derrick May) and began incorporating it into his sets and studio work. These new technologies allowed DJs to extend and transform disco tracks, creating the house sound." },
  { type: "text", content: "Frankie's contributions were eventually recognized formally. Chicago honored him with his own street and inducted him into the LGBTQ+ Hall of Fame. The city finally acknowledged what the community always knew." },

  { type: "text", content: "Gay clubs were among the first places DJs began experimenting with the TR-808. When disco records became harder to find after 1979, Chicago DJs like Frankie Knuckles in gay venues like The Warehouse used the TR-808 to extend disco tracks and create new sounds." },
  { type: "text", content: "The TR-909 followed in 1983 and found its home in gay clubs first. Detroit techno pioneer Derrick May famously brought a TR-909 to Frankie Knuckles at The Warehouse, predicting it would be 'the foundation of music for the next 10 years.' Gay venues became the testing ground for this revolutionary technology." },

  { type: "text", content: "Gay clubs served as technology incubators for the dance music industry. From the first two-turntable setups to drum machines and professional mixers, queer venues were where DJs first experimented with the tools that would define modern dance music." },
  
  { type: "title", content: "The AIDS Crisis Impact" },
  { type: "text", content: "The HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s devastated the dance music community. Many pioneers (including Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, Ron Hardy, Patrick Cowley, and Sylvester) either died from AIDS-related complications or lost close friends to the disease." },
  { type: "text", content: "Despite this tragedy, the club scene became a source of support and activism. People kept dancing and creating music as an act of defiance and healing, even as they lost loved ones. The community's resilience in the face of this crisis is part of dance music's legacy." },
  
  { type: "title", content: "Ballroom: The Houses" },

  { type: "text", content: "Starting in the 1970s, Black and Latino LGBTQ+ communities in New York built a vibrant house ballroom scene." },
  { type: "text", content: "Voguing wasn't just dance, it was storytelling, competition, and survival. The movements came from fashion magazines, but the attitude came from strength and resilience." },

  { type: "text", content: "Derrick May once described techno as 'George Clinton and Kraftwerk stuck in an elevator' — meaning it married Black American funk/disco roots with European synth futurism." },
  { type: "text", content: "While Detroit's techno scene was different from Chicago's house scene, both emerged from similar conditions - post-industrial cities where Black communities created new sounds from the ashes of economic decline." },

  { type: "title", content: "Techno Goes Global" },

  { type: "title", content: "The Global Spread" },
